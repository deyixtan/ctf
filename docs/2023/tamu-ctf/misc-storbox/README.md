Some hackers leaked out a few locations of the same coffee shop line for a meet up. We have sent agents out to all three of these locations but there was no luck finding them. Where else could they be meeting up?

Location 1: 1462 N Beauregard St B

Location 2: 801 N Glebe Rd

Location 3: 2925 S Glebe Rd

Flag format will be the street address with spaces replaced with underscores, for example: `gigem{200_Discovery_Dr}`

## Write-up
- After researching all three locations on Google, we discovered that Starbucks is a common coffee shop found in the search results. This aligns with the hint provided in the challenge title.
- These three locations are in close proximity to each other, forming a triangle-like shape in the region.
- Additionally, we found a Starbucks cafe located at `950 S George Mason Dr`, which is situated somewhere in the middle of this triangle.

Flag: `gigem{950_S_George_Mason_Dr}`
