# IMF#0: Your mission, should you choose to accept it
Category: System

## Description
The Infamous Mother Fluckers have been hired to take down a guy named Dave. I think his sister's husband's cousin's wife's brother's son had an affaire with our client's wife, and for some reason he want's to take it out on him. But who are we to judge right ? We're getting paid, that's enough for me.

I got you a job in the same development start-up as Dave. In fact, you are his team mate. I asked around in some underground circles, and word is on the streets that our guy is selling customer information. If you can get proof of that and send it to his boss, he'll get fired and we'll get paid. I'm counting on you.

And keep you eyes opened, you might find some other interseting stuff on the company's network.

For this mission, you are bob. Your ssh credentials are `bob:password`.
