# Remotely Exploitative - 3
Category: Celistic

## Description
Celestic’s security team believes that after the attackers used EternalBlue, they utilized a reverse TCP connection to gain control over the machine using a tool such as meterpreter.

Which port on the attacker’s machine did this reverse TCP connection call back to?

*Flag format: port number used for reverse TCP connection. Example: **4444***

## Write-up
- To locate the network logs associated with the reverse TCP connection, we can modify our filter by swapping the source and destination IP addresses: `destination.ip == 50.19.212.156 && source.ip == 10.111.10.65`. The IP addresses were obtained from the information provided in the [Remotely Exploitative - 2](../celistic-remotely-exploitative-2/README.md) scenario.
- Applying this filter, we were able to narrow down the network traffic to two packets under `Suricata Alerts - Logs` table in the `Suricata Alerts` dashboard.
- By examining these packets, we identified the source ports used, namely `445` and `42871`.
- The presence of the high port number `42871`, which appears random and unusual, suggests its association with the reverse TCP connection established during the attack.

Flag: `42871`
